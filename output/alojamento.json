The flat is in a quiet district, very safe too! it is located right next to Barcelona city hall- and it is also in a very romantic neighbourhood.  The building remains in a typical alleyway of the Gothic Quarter and behind the beatiful San Jaume square. The kitchen is fully equipped with every comfort and cleanliness, as well as the bathroom! The kitchen is available to all guests as long as you wash up at the end of each meal. It sounds like a really good deal !!  Any doubts or question, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me!

Not one of these soulless Ikea furnished holiday rentals. Please, treat it the same way as you would treat your own. The apartment is on 5th floor just under the roof. Theres an elevator if you dont feel like walking. What I like a lot about this apartment is that in summer it doesnt get hot. Because you can open windows on both sides of the living room, you can always create a draft that cools down the apartment in an instant. Trust me! One of the highlights is definitely the large roof terrace. This year I got lots of plants for it and its perfect for a breakfast in the sun. Feel free to use anything in the ki",

It is a 5 minute walk to \"Rosi Square\" where you can get the commuter rail into downtown Boston. If you drive, it is 7.9 miles to downtown Boston. Quiet, safe and private location. Separate studio apt in basement (airbnb.com/rooms/(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN))  available for 3 people if you have big group and another house  3 blocks away holds 9 people (airbnb.com/rooms/(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN))  Both separate cost. Guests can use the entire house but if your group is less than the entire house will fit,  you will have access to the number of bedrooms you need and the others will be closed so I dont have as much to clean. I ask for guests to please take off their shoes inside the house, and please no smoking. There is another apartment in the basement level which I may stay in if I am in town, but I am often away. I also come over to water the new grass which I am trying to grow! I am happy to interact or leave",
